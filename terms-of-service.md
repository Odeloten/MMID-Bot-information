# MMID Bot — Terms of Service
_Last updated: 18 November 2025_

---

## 1. Description
MMID Bot (“the Bot”) provides simplified access to MMID data inside Discord.  
All MMID information belongs to **Oasis** and their staff team.  
The Bot does **not** create, verify, or modify MMID data — it only displays it.

---

## 2. Usage
By using the Bot, you agree to:
- Use it only for personal and non-commercial purposes  
- Not abuse, automate, or attempt to disrupt the Bot  
- Not use the Bot for harassment or targeted attacks  

---

## 3. Data Handling
The Bot does **not** store:
- Discord IDs  
- Usernames  
- Messages  
- Interaction history  
- Logs of MMID lookups  

All processing happens temporarily in memory and is immediately discarded.

---

## 4. Availability
The Bot is privately hosted on a physical device.  
Uptime is not guaranteed, and interruptions may occur without notice.

---

## 5. Liability
The Bot is provided **“as is”**, without warranties of any kind.  
The Bot owner is not responsible for:
- Accuracy of MMID data (maintained by Oasis)  
- Actions taken by users based on the MMID information  
- Outages, bugs, downtime, or service interruptions  

---

## 6. Third-Party Services
The Bot temporarily uses:
- The MMID Google Sheet (Oasis)  
- Crafatar (for Minecraft skin rendering)

The Bot does not store, sell, or share personal data with any third party.

---

## 7. Termination
The Bot owner may restrict or revoke access at any time for any reason.

---

If you do not agree with these terms, you must stop using the Bot.
