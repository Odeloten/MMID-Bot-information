# MMID Bot — Privacy Policy
_Last updated: 18 November 2025_

---

## 1. Overview
This Privacy Policy explains how the MMID Bot (“the Bot”) processes information.  
Short version: **the Bot does not store any personal data.**

---

## 2. Data Collected
The Bot does **not** collect or store:
- Discord usernames  
- Discord IDs  
- Message content  
- Interaction logs  
- IP addresses  
- Search history  

The only user input received is:
- A Minecraft username (via the `/mmid` command)

This value is processed temporarily and never saved.

---

## 3. Data Sharing
The Bot does **not** share any information with third parties.  
It simply fetches publicly available MMID information maintained by **Oasis**.

---

## 4. Hosting
The Bot is hosted privately on a physical device.  
No external logging services or analytics tools are used.

---

## 5. Third-Party APIs
Brief requests may be made to:
- The Oasis MMID Google Sheet  
- Crafatar (for skin rendering)  

No personal data is transmitted to or stored by these services.

---

## 6. Security
Because the Bot stores no user data, there is no personal information at risk.  
Standard security measures (SSH hardening, firewalls, private hosting) are maintained.

---

## 7. Contact
If you have questions about this policy, contact the bot owner via Discord.
