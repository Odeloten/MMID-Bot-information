MMID Bot – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 18 November 2025

1. Overview

This Privacy Policy explains how the MMID Bot (“the Bot”) handles user information.
Short answer: it doesn’t store anything.

2. Information Collected

The Bot does not collect, store, or log:

Discord usernames

Discord IDs

Message content

Interaction logs

IP addresses

MMID search history

All processing happens in memory and is never saved.

3. Data Provided by Users

Users may provide:

a Minecraft username (via the /mmid command)

This value is used only to fetch MMID data and is not stored.

4. Data Sharing

The Bot does not share data with any third parties.
It simply retrieves existing information from the MMID sheet maintained by Oasis.

5. Hosting

The Bot is hosted privately on a Raspberry Pi device.
No external logging systems are used.

6. Third-Party APIs

The Bot may call these services temporarily:

Oasis MMID Google Sheet

Crafatar (for Minecraft skin rendering)

No personal data is sent to other services.

7. Security

Since the Bot stores no user data, there is no personal data at risk.
Standard security measures (SSH, firewall, private hosting) are maintained on the device.

8. Contact

If you have questions, contact the bot owner through Discord.
